If you haven't installed twitchio and / or dotenv yet, this won't work. You will have to run this into your command prompt in order to make this work on your PC:

```
pip install twitchio
pip install python-dotenv
```

This is the first commit, so there isn't anything special in here except for the above. When there are more features, they will get listed here to explain what they do / what you can use it for.

Note to myself:
`.env` is also included in the first commit without any information in it, to show other users you have to fill some stuff in.
