**With what command does the bug appear?**
(if you're not sure, no worries, dev will still try his best to find it)

**If the console shows an error, paste the error in here (to copy from the console, you might wanna use `CTRL+INSERT`)**
If the error is very long, you can just paste a screenshot down below here.
